# Build Complex Synth Tones from Scratch with Python

Learn how to generate rich, custom sounds by combining basic sine waves. Just with Python and Numpy/SciPy (and SoundDevice for saving audio files).

Treat it as a starting template or an example. The [tone_example.py](./tone_example.py) file already has an exemplary voice ready to be modified or used as a [WAV file](./example.wav) 

Sine waves here are NumPy arrays that can be modified in various ways.

Usually, you need to stay in the [-1, 1] range.
There's a function called *normalize* for that purpose.
