# Build Complex Synth Tones from Scratch with Python

The project is designed as a flexible starting point for creating unique sounds using *NumPy* and *SciPy* for audio manipulation
and *SoundDevice* for playback and file handling.
Treat it as a template kickstarter or an example.

Sine waves here are NumPy arrays that can be modified in various ways.

The [tone_example.py](./tone_example.py) file already has a sample tone ready to be modified or used as a [WAV file](./example.wav).
